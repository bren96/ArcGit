# ArcGit

ArcGit is a Version Control *helper library for ArcGIS Online content. ArcGit uses the ArcGIS REST API and ArcGIS API for Python. This is a helper library because it *helps developers manage versioning in ArcGIS Online, but is not a full version control library (like Git).

## Usage

### Clone

#### arcgit.clone_dashboard(itemID, *outputFolder)
- Creates a folder in the user's current directory, and pull the item's data
- Creates a copy of the item in AGOL and stores it in user's AGOL home folder.
- Creates a arcgit file that stores the itemId of the clone and original item

    arcgit.clone_dashboard(c9b3dbb892442463ab065efcb96dcd81c)

    dashboard folder structure
    Dashboard_{itemId}
        Description.JSON
        Data.JSON
        Maps
            Map_{itemId}

- If there are local changes that haven't been pushed to AGOL, FAIL (ask the user to first push there changes).
- If there are no local changes that haven't been pushed to AGOL, PUSH local JSON to original item data

    arcgit.merge(folderName)

COMING SOON:
